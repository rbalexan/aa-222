#Project1 Starter Code

- You can base your algorithm on those found in the book or online, but you must give credit.

### Prepare your README.pdf

In addition to the programming aspect, you are also required to submit (also on gradescope) a PDF writeup, worth 50% of the assignment. It should contain the following information:- A description of the method(s) you chose.
- A plot showing the path for Rosenbrock’s function with the objective contours and the path taken by your algorithm from three different starting points of your choice.
- Convergence plots for the three simple functions (Rosenbrock’s function, Himmelblau’s function, and Powell’s function).

- Submit your README.pdf on `Gradescope/AA222/Project 1 Writeup`
